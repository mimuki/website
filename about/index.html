    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      I have, like, so many things that I'll swing between. Sometimes I'll 
      go months without thinking about one of them, and then hyperfixate 
      on them for a while, and the cycle repeats. Here are some of those 
      things that came to mind. I also have things that I've done and 
      enjoyed, but haven't quite made it to 'hobby' status. I don't know 
      if or when I'll write about them, but I definitely have them.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h1 id="knitting">Knitting</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a huge fan of knitting, and have made a variety of things I'm proud 
      of. Maybe someday I'll write about them and have a really convinient link 
      to them here. Until then, I have <a href="/projects/knitting">this page 
      documenting specifically the things I donate to charity</a>. There's 
      something special abouta task thats both complex but simple once you wrap 
      your head around it. Taking something that's not useful on its own (balls 
      of yarn have limited usefulness as balls of yarn), and turning it into the 
      thing you wanted or needed. Super cool.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h1 id="vr">VR gaming</h1>
    <p>
      VR is also some (prohibitively expensive) tech I care about a 
      lot. I used to make custom avatars for VRChat and Neos, and have 
      countless hours in those games spent with strangers I'll never
      meet again. I also really enjoy singleplayer experiences like 
      Vermillion, a VR painting program for all your "painting on a 
      canvas" needs. As I play more games I might list them here. I
      currently play on a Meta Quest 2, and formerly used a Rift S.

  <section>
    <h1 id="keebs">Mechanical keyboards</h1>
    <p>
      Yet another surprisingly expensive hobby. I had a passive 
      interest in them, and owned a Logitech fullsize keyboard. But as 
      my physical health deteriorated, this became increasingly tough 
      on my joints and nerve pain. TL;DR: I bought a keebio iris rev. 
      4, taught myself colemak mod dh, and I can still use my 
      computer. So... yay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I have my keyboard strapped to my legs, so that's cool.
