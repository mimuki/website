These are the websites that I think are cool, or useful, or worth mentioning. Sorted alphabetically, until I decide a different order makes sense.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://beefox.xyz">beefox.xyz</a> - someone I cherish, who constantly brings new things into the world; especially art

<li>
<a href="https://circusfreaks.org/">circusfreaks.org</a> - professional grade whimsy brought to you by some of the finest clowns I've ever had the pleasure of talking to

<li>
<a href="https://kokoscript.com">kokoscript.com</a> - a charmingly retro-flavoured site, with many cool things to discover in it

</ul>
