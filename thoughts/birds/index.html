    <h1>/thoughts/birds/</h1>
    <p>
        I've been spending more time in the lounge room lately, which has
        a big, glass sliding door. If I open its blinds, I get a pretty
        good view of my backyard. As a result, I've also started noticing
        the wildlife, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having some sort of external <em>something</em> to be aware of
        has helped a lot with feeling more grounded and aware of the
        passage of time. I'd like to get some feed for the birds, but I'd
        need to first figure out what's safe for them. I'd also like to
        focus on fixing up the yard in general, too.

    <h1>The magpies</h1>
    <p>
      There seems to be two regular visitors- one that's a bit smaller,
      and likes to try and fight his reflection. The other one likes to
      lurk around too, but I haven't been able to figure out any of its
      patterns yet.

    <h1>The pigeons</h1>
    <p>
        There's also a pair of pigeons I've noticed once or twice. I'm
        not even completely sure they are pigeons at all, but they look
        pigeon-y enough that that's what I'm calling them. They like to
        poke around in the dead grass. I wonder if they're finding
        anything in there?
