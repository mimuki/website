    <h1>Birds are cool</h1> 
    
    <p>
    I've been spending more time in the lounge room lately, which has a big, glass sliding door. If I open its blinds, I get a pretty good view of my backyard. As a result, I've also started noticing the wildlife, too.

<h2>Keeping a grip on reality, in this economy?</h2>
<p>Having some sort of external something to be aware of has helped a lot with feeling more grounded and aware of the passage of time. I'd like to get some feed for the birds, but I'd need to first figure out what's safe for them. I'd also like to focus on fixing up the yard in general, too.</p>

<h2>The magpies</h2>
<p>There seems to be two regular visitors- one that's a bit smaller, and likes to try and fight his reflection. The other one likes to lurk around too, but I haven't been able to figure out any of its patterns yet.</p>

<h2>The pigeons</h2>
<p>There's also a pair of pigeons I've noticed once or twice. I'm not even completely sure they are pigeons at all, but they look pigeon-y enough that that's what I'm calling them. They like to poke around in the dead grass. I wonder if they're finding anything in there?</p>
