      The cool beep boops in my life. (this page is an eternally unfinished 
      project, but its especially WIP right now, with a lot of important detail

      I may be poor, but I make questionable financial decisions. Here are some 
      of them. (Software decisions specific to each device will also be listed 
      here)

      bits.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      I bought this used on eBay, and have kept the hardware stock (for now).
      The TN panel isn't the prettiest, but I don't notice the resolution & I'm
      rarely in situations the viewing angles are an issue. It came to me 
      running Windows 11- I used it briefly like that, and it was much more 
      zippy than I expected, but no computer of mine will run W11, so I 
      installed...
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Linux Mint.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I know some people see me as a computer wizard who would have some bespoke
      distro for Cool Linux Guys, but in all honesty I don't know what the hell 
      I'm doing despite so many years on Linux. I decided to go for "old 
      reliable" instead of "bleeding edge"; and besides, I didn't like rolling 
      release anyways. I think past me spent too much time focused on my 
      imagined "image" or "reputation" as a Linux user, but really I just want 
      to use a computer, so I just went with something simple.

      This is what works for me, except when it doesn't.

    <h2>Window Manager</h2>
    <p>
      I use AwesomeWM. My first tiling WM was i3, but I don't like their stock
      experience, and it doesn't give you a usable system to learn the tiling 
      mindset IMO. Now I know what binds work for me I could switch back, but...
      I like Awesome.

    <h2>Mouse Alternatives</h2>
    <p>
      As a disabled person, I need a lot of software based accessibility tools,
      mainly for working around how keyboard-heavy my digital life is.
    </p>
    <h3>Keynav</h3>
    <p>
      Keynav, and its windows cousin Keynavish, are my fallback for when things
      aren't keyboard only accessible. I love it dearly, and I have many
      opinions as to how it should work. I don't have the tech skills to fix its
      flaws, but it works enough.
    </p>
    <h3>QMK's Mouse Keys</h3>
    <p>
      I mean, it works. Its inherently slow and clunky, but it's better for 
      click and drag than Keynavish. (Keynav can be flaky too, but Keynavish is
      awful)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what I use for things like inventory management in Minecraft, for 
      example.
    </p>
    <h3>That Program I Use With An Xbox Controller On Windows</h3>
    <p>
      Forget the name since I rarely use it, it's <em>fine</em>, but it's rare I 
      find my xbox controller to be more convinient than any of the other 
      options. I use it when playing truck sim though, since I can navigate 
      menus with the dpad. Still annoyed that you can't use your keyboard for
      that.
    </p>
    <h3>KDE Connect</h3>
    <p>
      Love this for when I'm on the couch and wanting to chuck on a video on my 
      monitor, but it's also nice as a poor man's trackpad in general. It scrolls
      too fast, but otherwise works really well. I don't have an exceptionally 
      ergonomic setup for it, but I usually just use it in a pinch to open up a 
      video or something.
