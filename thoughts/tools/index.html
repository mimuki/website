<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I may be poor, but I make questionable financial decisions. Here are some of them. (Software decisions specific to each device will also be listed here)</p>
</section><section><h3 id="x270">Thinkpad x270</h3>
<p>Purchased: December 2022, for ~$250 (todo: check exact cost)</p>
<h4>Specs</h4>
<p>Summary: its ok</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-7300U CPU</li>
<li>8GB DDR4-2133 RAM</li>
<li>Intel HD 620 graphics</li>
<li>256GB SSD</li>
<li>1366 x 768 TN display</li>
<li>3 cell external battery + 3 cell internal battery (46Wh total)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there's other specifics you care about, ask, but that's the important bits.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>I bought this used on eBay, and have kept the hardware stock (for now). The TN panel isn't the prettiest, but I don't notice the resolution &amp; I'm rarely in situations the viewing angles are an issue. It came to me running Windows 11- I used it briefly like that, and it was much more zippy than I expected, but no computer of mine will run W11, so I installed...</p>
<p><em>Linux Mint.</em></p>
<p>I know some people see me as a computer wizard who would have some bespoke distro for Cool Linux Guys, but in all honesty I don't know what the hell I'm doing despite so many years on Linux. I decided to go for &quot;old reliable&quot; instead of &quot;bleeding edge&quot;; and besides, I didn't like rolling release anyways. I think past me spent too much time focused on my imagined &quot;image&quot; or &quot;reputation&quot; as a Linux user, but really I just want to use a computer, so I just went with something simple.</p>
<p>After a few months of that, though... I'm starting to wonder about the forbidden fruit again. Having packages be out of date is annoying, and I keep running into it in places that actually really affect me. If I can get a cheap machine for easy testing of my chezmoi scripts, I'm considering polishing that up so it's genuinely &quot;run the command, wait a while, PC is setup exactly to my liking after logging back in&quot;. And if it's that easy, I might as well finally try Arch or something. Using the AUR on Manjaro only caused problems, but I like the idea of it a lot.</p>
</section><section><h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>This is what works for me, except when it doesn't.</p>
<h3>Window Manager</h3>
<p>I use AwesomeWM. My first tiling WM was i3, but I don't like their stock experience, and it doesn't give you a usable system to learn the tiling mindset IMO. Now I know what binds work for me I could switch back, but... I like Awesome.</p>
<p>Awesome's config files are all in Lua, which i had a tiny bit of familiarity with thanks to making Rainmeter skins back in 2016. But, you can tweak quite a lot without actually knowing how Lua works- case in point, I am nowhere near proficient in it, and I've been getting stuff done fine.</p>
<h3>Mouse alternatives</h3>
<p>As a disabled person, I need a lot of software based accessibility tools, mainly for working around how keyboard-heavy my digital life is.</p>
<h4>Keynav</h4>
<p>Keynav, and its windows cousin Keynavish, are my fallback for when things aren't keyboard only accessible. I love it dearly, and I have many opinions as to how it should work. I don't have the tech skills to fix its flaws, but it works enough.</p>
<p>My main gripes tend to be with programs that are written badly (or in a way that breaks Keynav), or with programs with already inaccessible workflows. Like say, Unity. All of it's UI needs to be microscopic to fit on screen, and tiny buttons are Keynav's weak point.</p>
<h4>QMK's mouse keys</h4>
<p>I mean, it works. Its inherently slow and clunky, but it's better for click and drag than Keynavish. (Keynav can be flaky too, but Keynavish is awful)</p>
<p>This is what I use for things like inventory management in Minecraft, for example. I've started a Keynav inventory manager in Keynav, and while it's very clever, it can't &quot;smartly&quot; know where all the inventory slots are when they get moved around, so unless there's a Minecraft mod that forces them to be in consistent places, I don't think I'll actually use it much. But I'd rather a Minecraft mod that somehow &quot;tells&quot; keynav where things are, and what kind of interface is visible (e.g crafting table, double chest, furnace and so on)</p>
<h4>That Program I Use With An Xbox Controller On Windows</h4>
<p>Forget the name since I rarely use it, it's fine, but it's rare I find my xbox controller to be more convinient than any of the other options. I use it when playing truck sim though, since I can navigate menus with the dpad. Still annoyed that you can't use your keyboard for that.</p>
<h4>KDE Connect</h4>
<p>Love this for when I'm on the couch and wanting to chuck on a video on my monitor, but it's also nice as a poor man's trackpad in general. It scrolls too fast, but otherwise works really well. I don't have an exceptionally ergonomic setup for it, but I usually just use it in a pinch to open up a video or something.</p>
