<p>I may be poor, but I make questionable financial decisions. Here are some of them. (Software decisions specific to each device will also be listed here)</p>
</section><section><h3 id="x270">Thinkpad x270</h3>
<p>Purchased: December 2022, for ~$250 (todo: check exact cost)</p>
<h4>Specs</h4>
<p>Summary: its ok</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-7300U CPU</li>
<li>8GB DDR4-2133 RAM</li>
<li>Intel HD 620 graphics</li>
<li>256GB SSD</li>
<li>1366 x 768 TN display</li>
<li>3 cell external battery + 3 cell internal battery (46Wh total)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there's other specifics you care about, ask, but that's the important bits.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>I bought this used on eBay, and have kept the hardware stock (for now). From what I can tell this laptop was only lightly used by its previous owner, with minimal physical damage and a few hundred power cycles. Whatever life it had before, it was really handled with care, which is cool.</p>
<p>The TN panel isn't the prettiest, but I don't notice the resolution &amp; I'm rarely in situations the viewing angles are an issue. It came to me running Windows 11- I used it briefly like that, and it was much more zippy than I expected, but no computer of mine will run W11, so I installed Linux Mint.</p>
<p>Battery has held up fairly well (as of October 2023), and while it doesn't last the longest, using a lightweight WM and no compositor helps a lot. It also charges very quickly, which is nice.</p>
</section><section><h3 id="s10e">Samsung S10e</h3>
<p>Purchased: Early 2023, for ~$200 (todo: check exact cost &amp; time)</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>I bought this used on eBay, and it was in pretty good condition. One almost invisible scratch on the screen, about a centimeter up from the charging port, and one longer, noticable in the right angle scratch about a centimeter down from the power button, extending out towards the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>It's a US model phone, so I had to flash it to think it's the international variant; even still, certain apps like Uber and Etsy still default to miles or other USisms.</p>
<p>The performance is really impressive, though I haven't owned a phone in several years. It struggles with Voice Access, but that's partly because Voice Access is bad compared to the iOS alternative. Otherwise, it does the job fine, and better than a new phone of the same price.</p>
<p>I've kept it in a case since I got it. Nothing bulky, but it's saved me from plenty of drops from wheelchair height (sometimes using my metal footplate to &quot;soften&quot; the landing).</p>
</section><section><h3 id="m700">The Little Homeserver That Could</h3>
<p>Purchased: TBD</p>
<h4>Specs</h4>
<p>TBD</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>I don't actually own this yet! But it's going to be a late birthday gift, so I've prepared this space for when I do get it. TLDR: its a thin client I'm repurposing to do super light stuff like Profanity, Musikcube, and maybe be a NFS. Super power efficient in theory, and I am very hype.</p>
</section><section><h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>This is what works for me, except when it doesn't.</p>
<h3>Operating System</h3>
<p>I currently use Linux Mint, but I'm tempted to try something new, possibly Debian. Time will tell :)</p>
<h3>Window Manager</h3>
<p>I use AwesomeWM. My first tiling WM was i3, but I don't like their stock experience, and it doesn't give you a usable system to learn the tiling mindset IMO. Now I know what binds work for me I could switch back, but... I like Awesome.</p>
<p>Awesome's config files are all in Lua, which i had a tiny bit of familiarity with thanks to making Rainmeter skins back in 2016. But, you can tweak quite a lot without actually knowing how Lua works- case in point, I am nowhere near proficient in it, and I've been getting stuff done fine.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>As a disabled person, I need a lot of software based accessibility tools, mainly for working around how keyboard-heavy my digital life is.</p>
<h4>Keynav</h4>
<p>Keynav, and its windows cousin Keynavish, are my fallback for when things aren't keyboard only accessible. I love it dearly, and I have many opinions as to how it should work. I don't have the tech skills to fix its flaws, but it works enough.</p>
<p>My main gripes tend to be with programs that are written badly (or in a way that breaks Keynav), or with programs with already inaccessible workflows. Like say, Unity. All of it's UI needs to be microscopic to fit on screen, and tiny buttons are Keynav's weak point.</p>
<h4>Talon</h4>
<p>Talon is voice controls for your computer, which I use for situations I can't have accessible peripherals, but can manage a microphone. A common usecase is when I'm on my laptop in bed, because its keyboard absolutely destroys my hands and arms in a matter of minutes, but my custom made one doesn't really work for lying down.</p>
<p>I struggle with it because my best mic is attached to uncomfortable headphones, and my accent isn't white american enough to be flawless. It also takes an amount of self control, because it's a really slow input method while you're learning. I'm so used to living with pain that &quot;less painful, but slower&quot; isn't enough to motivate me. Like, I'm going to be in pain anyway. So I'm less dilligent about using it than I should be, and my nerve pain has gotten a lot worse as a result. I think I'd be way better if I had a convinient mic, though. Maybe one of those wireless head mounted ones, that isn't also trying to be headphones.</p>
<h4>QMK's mouse keys</h4>
<p>I mean, it works. Its inherently slow and clunky, but it's better for click and drag than Keynavish. Keynav can be flaky too, but Keynavish is truly awful.</p>
<h4>KDE Connect</h4>
<p>Love this for when I'm on the couch and wanting to chuck on a video on my monitor, but it's also nice as a poor man's trackpad in general. It scrolls too fast, but otherwise works really well. I don't have an exceptionally ergonomic setup for it, but I usually just use it in a pinch to open up a video or something.</p>
