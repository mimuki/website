      After sitting on this for a while, procrastinating a rewrite to
      fix some phrasing things I didn't like, jan Misali made a video that
      summarizes our feelings better than we ever could. Everything here 
      remains for posterity's sake, but you probably just want to watch
      the video.

    <p>
      Tone tags are intended to clarify your phrasing and help
      disambiguate online conversation. Tone is hard on the internet, and
      their goal is to explicitly state tone in a way that removes
      ambiguity. I don't use them, and I don't like them, so I'm
      critiquing them at length here.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>
      Don't be mean to someone because they use tone tags. Don't be mean
      to someone because they <em>don't</em> use tone tags. Not everyone
      will benefit from the same accessibility tool, and that's okay. For
      those they help, tone tags are awesome and vastly improve online
      encounters. I'm just not one of those people, and I want to talk
      about them from my perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      All tone tags used are me naming them, not marking the tone of the
      previous statement. Unless I'm quoting someone else, that applies to
      everything on this website.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h1 id = "what">What are tone tags?</h1>
    <p>
      While increasingly common, there's a good chance someone won't know
      why I care so much about what looks like random slash commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tone tags are short strings used in casual writing to inform the
      reader of the writer's intent, or intended tone. They've been around
      the internet for decades, but had a large popularity spike from
      reddit, where things like /s for sarcasm, and /j for jokes became
      popular, along with some more reddit-exclusive ones like /uj, which
      I don't care to explain. I like not thinking about reddit when I can
      avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't cared to dig deep into the "oldest usage", but <a href=
      "https://gamedev.net/forums/topic/224549-how-excellent-ltsarcasmgt/"
      >here's use of &lt;/sarcasm&gt; in 2004.</a> I hope MrPoopypants
      had a quick recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their second peak in usage happened in the late 2010s, where a whole
      library of common tone tags suddenly entered the speech patterns of
      many. This group tends to be the more inclusive, accessibility
      minded youth of the 'net, with a very large neurodiverse population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many lists of tone tags have been compiled over the years, and used
      to varying extents. These are the ones I encounter regularly in my
      circles, (on top of the /s and /j I mentioned earlier) defined to
      give the reader a good picture of what intents are seen as needing
      disambiguation:
      <ul>
        <li>/gen: genuine</li>
        <li>/lh: light-hearted</li>
        <li>/npa: not passive-agressive</li>
        <li>/nm: not mad</li>
        <li>/hj: half-joke</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      You'll notice a general trend here, of tone tags "softening" one's
      speech. It's rare to see /m, but it's counterpart /nm is relatively
      common. The lack of things like face or body expressions, varying
      your pitch or intonation, etc, all cause written text to seem
      "blunt by default" when compared to spoken or signed conversation.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 id = "pros">The good</h1>
    <p>
      Tone tags have plenty of aspirations. Many people like using them
      because clarifying what you mean when it could be potentially read
      worse is useful!
    </p>
    <p>
      They're especially popular in neurodiverse spaces, as many folks in
      them struggle with reading social nuance, or communicating their
      own. In theory, they're useful, predictable shortcuts to avoid
      conflict or awkward situations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 id = "cons">The bad</h1>
    <p>
      That sounds awesome, and it's pretty clear how they became so
      popular so suddenly. But there are some flaws they have that I don't
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first one, which is more clear if this page is your first
      introduction to them: they aren't always intuitive, and there's a
      risk the other person doesn't know what they are. There's lots of
      room for misinterpretation even if you <em>do</em> know about tone
      tags. I've seen /r (an uncommon tone tag for "romantic") mistakenly
      used for /ref (a slightly less uncommon tone tag for "reference"),
      which drastically shifted how the other party interacted as a
      result.
     </p>
    <p>
      There's no authority on tone tags, so they spring up from community
      usage, and have fuzzy overlap that complicates things. A good
      example of that is the coexistance of /gen (genuine) and /srs
      (serious), which can largely be used interchangeably. A /ij (inside
      joke) is also a /ref (reference), /lh is often just a mild /j, and
      so on. I don't think an authority on tone tags would make the
      situation any better, but I wanted to point this flaw out for anyone
      who hasn't seen it first hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lesser known tone tags are often met with a "what's /lyr?" or
      similar question. This makes them generally redundant, like all
      UAUIS (Unknown Acronyms Used In Speech). If you need to explain what
      it means anyway, why not just...explain what it means, without the
      tone tag?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another problem is that not everyone uses tone tags in the same way.
      Some people are extremely generous, and use them in the same way
      people use "lol" for anything from "funny" to "I feel weird not
      saying lol here, lol". This causes the actual meaning behind them to
      get pretty vague- what does it mean to be /lh? Despite tone tags
      being used primarily by and for neurodivergent people, learning
      which tone tag is used when can be a whole challenge in itself if
      you're neurodivergent, speaking from experience. Some people "get"
      them better than others, because neurodiversity is not a monolith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people use tone tags for the sake of a joke, like an innocent
      statement being tagged /threat because it's funny. These are pretty
      clear to notice, but over time I've watched this non-serious use get
      more and more difficult to tell apart from genuine statements. Even
      now, not even /gen can be trusted at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very obvious ambiguity in tone tags is in /hj. What does it mean
      for something to be a half-joke? There are many interpretations,
      such as:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Part of this message is 100% serious, part is 100% joke"</li>
        <li>"What I'm saying is serious, but I'm saying it in a jokey way
        </li>
        <li>"This message is somewhat a joke, but I haven't written it
        well enough to be actually funny/a full joke"</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Which isn't too bad, except when you factor in that <em>/hj doesn't
      tell you which parts are serious and which parts are jokes</em>.
      This compounds with the issue of people adding them in for flavour
      like "lol", to cause it to be... bad. There's so much social nuance
      for a tool designed to disambiguate social nuance, it just feels
      entirely unuseful when used like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people also like to use tone tags to try and "get away with
      being an asshole", and use tone tags as a defense of their
      behaviour. I have personal experience of people saying hateful
      things followed by a /j or /ref etc, so that when I complained, they
      had the cover of "its just a joke, I added a tone tag so you'd know"
      or "I didn't mean to sound rude, I have autism and that makes me
      sound mean". These people know full well what they're doing, and are
      being malicious about it, knowing they can get away with it long
      enough to cause problems. Over the years this has gotten less
      common, but it certainly hasn't stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're wondering why I refuse to use them myself, and
      generally request that others don't use them with me? That's why.
      Tone tags are too singed in negativity and deceit for me, that I
      can't take someone's /npa as anything other than "I am being passive
      aggressive and want you to know it, I want you to feel unsafe in
      this space". Logically understanding someone has good intent doesn't
      soothe my emotional, under-medicated brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its also a great litmus test for knowing who will respect my
      boundaries, even if they don't understand my reasons. If someone is
      determined to do the thing I asked them not to, they're only going
      to breach my trust in more directly harmful ways if I let them stick
      around.
    </p>

    <h1 id = "alternatives">Potential alternatives</h1>
    <p>
      Since I'm so unimpressed by them, I'm "supposed" to have a perfectly
      thought out solution that covers every edge case perfectly,
      apparently. Prescriptively describing how other people "should"
      write sucks, and I don't like it. But for people looking for an
      alternative, maybe this will give some ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest fix would be to get rid of them entirely, and normalize
      clarifying in full sentences what you mean. There's absolutely no
      way that can go wrong. (this is a joke, and I'm making it on purpose
      to demonstrate my point)
    </p>
    <p>
      It might seem clunky to phrase things longform like that, and it
      does introduce its own accessibility concerns, but in many cases a
      simple "(I'm joking)" is totally fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some good intermediary changes would be to spell out tone tags as
      full words, like /sarcasm. Many devices let you autoexpand a
      shortcut into a longer phrase, so for no extra effort an entire
      talking point of mine is conviniently solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, any word or part of speech is going to have its meaning
      shift over time. "Literally" isn't always literal, and "/gen" isn't
      always genuine. Trying to make a bulletproof system like that is
      doomed to always miss the mark.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 id="end">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      Ultimately, my opinions won't sway how tone tags are used. But, my
      stance of "please don't use tone tags with me" is an uncommon one,
      and naturally many people ask me about it. So I decided to write my
      feelings anyway, since I know it's just saving future-me some time
      explaining them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're reading this because I didn't want to explain my reasons,
      and linked you here instead? Thanks for your time. It's super cool
      and awesome of you that you respect peoples boundaries, and want to
      understand how to be a considerate friend.
