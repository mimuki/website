		<p>
			Tone tags are intended to clarify your phrasing and help
			disambiguate online conversation. Tone is hard on the internet, and
			their goal is to explicitly state tone in a way that removes
			ambiguity. I don't use them, and I don't like them, so I'm
			critiquing them at length here.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
		<p>
			Don't be mean to someone because they use tone tags. Don't be mean
			to someone because they <em>don't</em> use tone tags. Not everyone
			will benefit from the same accessibility tool, and that's okay. For
			those they help, tone tags are awesome and vastly improve online
			encounters. I'm just not one of those people, and I want to talk
			about them from my perspective.
		</p>
		<p>
			All tone tags used are me naming them, not marking the tone of the
			previous statement. Unless I'm quoting someone else, that applies to
			everything on this website.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1 id = "what">What are tone tags?</h1>
		<p>
			While increasingly common, there's a good chance someone won't know
			why I care so much about what looks like random slash commands.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tone tags are short strings used in casual writing to inform the
			reader of the writer's intent, or intended tone. They've been around
			the internet for decades, but had a large popularity spike from
			reddit, where things like /s for sarcasm, and /j for jokes became
			popular, along with some more reddit-exclusive ones like /uj, which
			I don't care to explain. I like not thinking about reddit when I can
			avoid it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I haven't cared to dig deep into the "oldest usage", but <a href=
			"https://gamedev.net/forums/topic/224549-how-excellent-ltsarcasmgt/"
			>here's use of &lt;/sarcasm&gt; in 2004.</a> I hope MrPoopypants
			had a quick recovery.
		</p>
		<p>
			Their second peak in usage happened in the late 2010s, where a whole
			library of common tone tags suddenly entered the speech patterns of
			many. This group tends to be the more inclusive, accessibility
			minded youth of the 'net, with a very large neurodiverse population.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many lists of tone tags have been compiled over the years, and used
			to varying extents. These are the ones I encounter regularly in my
			circles, (on top of the /s and /j I mentioned earlier) defined to
			give the reader a good picture of what intents are seen as needing
			disambiguation:
			<ul>
				<li>/gen: genuine</li>
				<li>/lh: light-hearted</li>
				<li>/npa: not passive-agressive</li>
				<li>/nm: not mad</li>
				<li>/hj: half-joke</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			You'll notice a general trend here, of tone tags "softening" one's
			speech. It's rare to see /m, but it's counterpart /nm is relatively
			common. The lack of things like face or body expressions, varying
			your pitch or intonation, etc, all cause written text to seem
			"blunt by default" when compared to spoken or signed conversation.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h1 id = "pros">The good</h1>
		<p>
			Tone tags have plenty of aspirations. Many people like using them
			because clarifying what you mean when it could be potentially read
			worse is useful!
		</p>
		<p>
			They're especially popular in neurodiverse spaces, as many folks in
			them struggle with reading social nuance, or communicating their
			own. In theory, they're useful, predictable shortcuts to avoid
			conflict or awkward situations.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h1 id = "cons">The bad</h1>
		<p>
			That sounds awesome, and it's pretty clear how they became so
			popular so suddenly. But there are some flaws they have that I don't
			like.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first one, which is more clear if this page is your first
			introduction to them: they aren't always intuitive, and there's a
			risk the other person doesn't know what they are. There's lots of
			room for misinterpretation even if you <em>do</em> know about tone
			tags. I've seen /r (an uncommon tone tag for "romantic") mistakenly
			used for /ref (a slightly less uncommon tone tag for "reference"),
			which drastically shifted how the other party interacted as a
			result.
		 </p>
		<p>
			There's no authority on tone tags, so they spring up from community
			usage, and have fuzzy overlap that complicates things. A good
			example of that is the coexistance of /gen (genuine) and /srs
			(serious), which can largely be used interchangeably. A /ij (inside
			joke) is also a /ref (reference), /lh is often just a mild /j, and
			so on. I don't think an authority on tone tags would make the
			situation any better, but I wanted to point this flaw out for anyone
			who hasn't seen it first hand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lesser known tone tags are often met with a "what's /lyr?" or
			similar question. This makes them generally redundant, like all
			UAUIS (Unknown Acronyms Used In Speech). If you need to explain what
			it means anyway, why not just...explain what it means, without the
			tone tag?
		</p>
		<p>
			Another problem is that not everyone uses tone tags in the same way.
			Some people are extremely generous, and use them in the same way
			people use "lol" for anything from "funny" to "I feel weird not
			saying lol here, lol". This causes the actual meaning behind them to
			get pretty vague- what does it mean to be /lh? Despite tone tags
			being used primarily by and for neurodivergent people, learning
			which tone tag is used when can be a whole challenge in itself if
			you're neurodivergent, speaking from experience. Some people "get"
			them better than others, because neurodiversity is not a monolith.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some people use tone tags for the sake of a joke, like an innocent
			statement being tagged /threat because it's funny. These are pretty
			clear to notice, but over time I've watched this non-serious use get
			more and more difficult to tell apart from genuine statements. Even
			now, not even /gen can be trusted at times.
		</p>
		<p>
			A very obvious ambiguity in tone tags is in /hj. What does it mean
			for something to be a half-joke? There are many interpretations,
			such as:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Part of this message is 100% serious, part is 100% joke"</li>
				<li>"What I'm saying is serious, but I'm saying it in a jokey way
				</li>
				<li>"This message is somewhat a joke, but I haven't written it
				well enough to be actually funny/a full joke"</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			Which isn't too bad, except when you factor in that <em>/hj doesn't
			tell you which parts are serious and which parts are jokes</em>.
			This compounds with the issue of people adding them in for flavour
			like "lol", to cause it to be... bad. There's so much social nuance
			for a tool designed to disambiguate social nuance, it just feels
			entirely unuseful when used like this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some people also like to use tone tags to try and "get away with
			being an asshole", and use tone tags as a defense of their
			behaviour. I have personal experience of people saying hateful
			things followed by a /j or /ref etc, so that when I complained, they
			had the cover of "its just a joke, I added a tone tag so you'd know"
			or "I didn't mean to sound rude, I have autism and that makes me
			sound mean". These people know full well what they're doing, and are
			being malicious about it, knowing they can get away with it long
			enough to cause problems. Over the years this has gotten less
			common, but it certainly hasn't stopped.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're wondering why I refuse to use them myself, and
			generally request that others don't use them with me? That's why.
			Tone tags are too singed in negativity and deceit for me, that I
			can't take someone's /npa as anything other than "I am being passive
			aggressive and want you to know it, I want you to feel unsafe in
			this space". Logically understanding someone has good intent doesn't
			soothe my emotional, under-medicated brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			Its also a great litmus test for knowing who will respect my
			boundaries, even if they don't understand my reasons. If someone is
			determined to do the thing I asked them not to, they're only going
			to breach my trust in more directly harmful ways if I let them stick
			around.
		</p>

		<h1 id = "alternatives">Potential alternatives</h1>
		<p>
			Since I'm so unimpressed by them, I'm "supposed" to have a perfectly
			thought out solution that covers every edge case perfectly,
			apparently. Prescriptively describing how other people "should"
			write sucks, and I don't like it. But for people looking for an
			alternative, maybe this will give some ideas.
		</p>
		<p>
			The simplest fix would be to get rid of them entirely, and normalize
			clarifying in full sentences what you mean. There's absolutely no
			way that can go wrong. (this is a joke, and I'm making it on purpose
			to demonstrate my point)
		</p>
		<p>
			It might seem clunky to phrase things longform like that, and it
			does introduce its own accessibility concerns, but in many cases a
			simple "(I'm joking)" is totally fine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some good intermediary changes would be to spell out tone tags as
			full words, like /sarcasm. Many devices let you autoexpand a
			shortcut into a longer phrase, so for no extra effort an entire
			talking point of mine is conviniently solved.
		</p>
		<p>
			Honestly, any word or part of speech is going to have its meaning
			shift over time. "Literally" isn't always literal, and "/gen" isn't
			always genuine. Trying to make a bulletproof system like that is
			doomed to always miss the mark.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h1 id="end">Conclusion</h1>
		<p>
			Ultimately, my opinions won't sway how tone tags are used. But, my
			stance of "please don't use tone tags with me" is an uncommon one,
			and naturally many people ask me about it. So I decided to write my
			feelings anyway, since I know it's just saving future-me some time
			explaining them.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're reading this because I didn't want to explain my reasons,
			and linked you here instead? Thanks for your time. It's super cool
			and awesome of you that you respect peoples boundaries, and want to
			understand how to be a considerate friend.
