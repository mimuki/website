<h2>I'm grateful for the plural community, but also. please stop</h2>
<p>I avoid dedicated plural communities these days, and I'm happier for it. I'm still just as plural as always, and I don't think being openly plural or in plural communities has to be bad. But it's so rare I see the latter done well, so I simply don't. I think my feelings tie pretty closely with my experiences with trauma &amp; interpersonal connections, and that aside from the obvious &quot;fighting bad&quot; my takes are especially personal &amp; not representative of what I think you should think.</p>
<p>When you have a community full of neurodivergent, mentally ill, often traumatized folks, in all sorts of stages of recovery/self discovery? It happens. We're all on our own paths in life, and for the most part I don't have any genuine interpersonal hatred for any of them. The intentional malice aspect is usually uncommon, anyways. But man plural spaces are so full of the kind of people I need to avoid for my own mental health. Every so often I need to reach out into the broader plural community for one reason or another, and a few days later I'm telling myself &quot;never again.&quot;.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Social norms &amp; isolated communities</h2>
<p>Of course the folks that gatekeep plurality suck. Their ideals of &quot;I get to be the final say on your existence&quot; suck. Its the same kind of suck you see in all sorts of communities, and not much of value would come from me talking about it. I'd like if people could help each other to question their own experiences- like what you see in religious spaces when someone's talking about their UPG- but I don't see it happening any time soon.</p>
<p>A lot of plural spaces also skew younger, and that's fine! I'm glad that kids needing community can find it. But I'm getting older, and the style of interaction popular with these folks isn't for me. I don't like tone tags, or that sort of casual &quot;dumping my bad mood on random people in a general channel&quot;, but both of those are pretty common and often normal. There's a certain flavour to communication I see that just feels...mean. Mean, and unusually hostile, and it reminds me of how certain kinds of people can make any mundane action have a mean spirited, threatening, bad-faith undertone.</p>
<p>By being a stigmatized community, a lot of plural folks get the mindset that they know best, and the world is out to get them. Why listen to &quot;experts&quot; when they know better? And like, I can't even be mad! There's a lot of truth in their takes, honestly. There's so much about the medical system (&amp; the medicalization of plurality) that is bad, and is incongruous to the lived experiences of people. But their &quot;why&quot; isn't the same as my &quot;why&quot;, which makes it frustrating- there's a lot of &quot;throwing the baby out with the bath water&quot;, when the issue has a lot more nuance than that.</p>
<p>As a result you see plenty of &quot;I am going to dismiss what you said because it doesn't align with my personal experiences&quot;, and &quot;I don't know you, so I am assuming I know more than you&quot;. I really get why people get like that. I don't like it and it hurts to read, but I can't bring myself to say &quot;hey your approach to this situation sucked&quot;. They'll figure it out in their own time. And if they don't it doesn't have to be my problem.</p>
<p>If you spend any length of time in a plural community, you'll bump into Drama. I don't know what it is about plural spaces and starting pointless drama, but boy does it happen. I see it way less on fedi, interestingly, and in general it does seem to be less than it used to be. Still such an exhausting and pointless thing to encounter, and I wish people just... wouldn't.</p>

<h2>It's not you, its The Man</h2>
<p>My gripes are issues in every community, but from what I've seen it feels like (certain kinds of) plural communities are much more potent with it. Discord servers that are incidentally plural friendly/have an awareness of plurality? Often good! Discord servers centered around plurality? Often...flawed. Often not the kinds of places I need to be in at this point of my journey. I wonder about if the issue is &quot;the kinds of people needing to join plural servers are the kinds of people I don't mesh with&quot;. I know I used to be those people, and I liked plural servers much more then. Maybe it's maturity? Patience? My point in my journey of recovering from trauma? No idea.</p>
<p>Maybe my issue is with Discord as a whole. But isolating myself from a platform like that is only isolating myself, really. There are &quot;potentially better&quot; platforms but the issue is people and corporations, and it's generally inescapable. Still refuse to use tik-tok, though.</p>
<p>Maybe its a societal thing? Social media encouraging a more inflammatory, attention-grabbing way of interpersonal connections. Predatory platforms platforming particularly...uh... bad people. Ran out of P's. I've avoided &quot;mainstream social media&quot; as best as one can in the current year, so maybe I'm the one who's out of touch. In any case, it doesn't hurt me very much to just ignore them, so that's what I like to do.</p>

<h2>The future</h2>
<p>I don't think that any meaningful change is gonna happen in the next few years. I've been here a while, and for the most part the &quot;general plural community&quot; has stayed similarly bad. My solution has been to stick to plural spaces I enjoy, which for the most part is friends I've already made. A plural framework for understanding yourself is great, but I also (selfishly) wish that some people aware of plurality weren't.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're full of frustration and need an outlet, so here I am, outlet-ing. I don't actually think this will be of much value to people who aren't me, but I think sharing this is gonna help me with my &quot;only the most polished content can go on my website&quot;, which stops me from the genuine self expression I encourage in my friends.</p>
