<h2>Why do mice suck?</h2>
<p>A standard mouse is great as an input method many people can figure out. Touch screens are better intuitively, but a mouse enables easy left/right/middle click distinction, as well as a more compact UI overall, which is important for power users and &quot;getting shit done&quot;. But where mice fail is their ergonomics. They aren't the worst, admittedly. But they clash with a keyboard, forcing a user into an asymmetrical posture most of the time. That's inconvinient at best, painful at worst. They also force an unnatural hand position, (forearm pronation = ouch) and require painful, repetitive motions for fine control.</p>
<p>And besides, while less impactful than the ergonomics concerns, there's no concept of &quot;home&quot; for a mouse, and your muscle memory suffers as a result. Sure, you can memorize how far to move to get the cursor to move a certain distance, but games like Trombone Champ illustrate the issue really well. It's much easier to memorize the absolute positions of a real trombone, than the relative adjustments needed when using a mouse.</p>
<p>There's plenty of alternative takes on what a mouse should be. There's the objectively terrible ones, like that weirdly thin Apple mouse. There's the &quot;perfect for a niche&quot; ones like MMO mice. You've got your vertical mice and mice with trackballs built in, too, but they inherently can't solve all the issues that a mouse creates.</p>
<p>Mice with a thumb trackball trap you in that forearm pronating position, and while they do eliminate the pain from microadjustments done with your thumb and outer fingers, they instead put the entire burden of moving a cursor to your thumb. If anything, an ergonomic input method should diversify how you use it, to balance out overuse pains. That concept is a bit idealist though, since many ergonomic inputs are designed to be maximally ergonomic for one position, and a more universal input often means an un-ergonomic design. (think ambidextrous mice, and their contours)</p>
<p>I've heard of people tenting their mouse w/ thumb trackball, but that only solves the pronation. It's the best fix if you can't access a different input method, but it's not great for someone like me, considering buying a new one.</p>
<p>I also mentioned vertical mice, and I think you can infer what bothers me about them. In a sense they're the inverse of a thumb trackball'd mouse. Better for your forearms, but still in the trappings of painful microadjustments. Inherently by making your hands move something with weight, you're adding extra resistance. There comes a point where less weight is worse, of course, as anyone who's tried to write in the air in VR can confirm :p.</p>
<p>So, you'd be right in assuming i've pretty much dismissed the idea of a mouse-shaped input method. That leaves a few options, though, which I will ramble about at length.</p>
<p>Trackpads are my current contender for optimal input method. Their weaknesses don't apply to me, since I already can't play mouse heavy games. They're ambidextrous, and have less moving parts (and less maintenance) than a trackball. I'm not opposed to a trackball, mind you. Once I exhaust potential trackpads to buy, I'll probably look at trackballs some more.</p>
<p>Trackpads aren't without cons though. I've struggled to find a wireless trackpad that's good value for money. It seems like there's not much competition beyond the Apple trackpad, and weird no-name Amazon ones with questionable driver support. Additionally, the macro movement of moving from my keyboard to a trackpad is not much better than that with a mouse. At least the stationary nature of a trackpad makes it suitable for mounting between my keyboard, on my lap. That's a big win for portablility, especially if I can get help designing a good mounting system.</p>
<p>Trackballs have some very clear wins in the kind of thing I like to do- I imagine controlling the Blender camera by rolling a ball around in place would be super intuitive, even if a similar method w/ a trackpad would be comparable. They also look really fun.</p>
