		<h1>Why do mice suck?</h1>
		<p>
			A standard mouse is great as an input method many people can
			figure out. Touch screens are better intuitively, but a mouse
			enables easy left/right/middle click distinction, as well as a
			more compact UI overall, which is important for power users and
			"getting shit done". But where mice fail is their ergonomics. They
			aren't the worst, admittedly. But they clash with a keyboard,
			forcing a user into an asymmetrical posture most of the time.
			That's inconvinient at best, painful at worst. They also force an
			unnatural hand position, (forearm pronation = ouch) and require
			painful, repetitive motions for fine control.
		</p>
		<p>
			And besides, while less impactful than the ergonomics concerns,
			there's no concept of "home" for a mouse, and your muscle memory
			suffers as a result. Sure, you can memorize how far to move to get
			the cursor to move a certain distance, but games like Trombone
			Champ illustrate the issue really well. It's much easier to
			memorize the absolute positions of a real trombone, than the
			relative adjustments needed when using a mouse.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's plenty of alternative takes on what a mouse should be.
			There's the objectively terrible ones, like that weirdly thin
			Apple mouse. There's the "perfect for a niche" ones like MMO mice.
			You've got your vertical mice and mice with trackballs built in,
			too, but they inherently can't solve all the issues that a mouse
			creates.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mice with a thumb trackball trap you in that forearm pronating
			position, and while they do eliminate the pain from microadjustments
			done with your thumb and outer fingers, they instead put the entire
			burden of moving a cursor to your thumb. If anything, an ergonomic
			input method should diversify how you use it, to balance out overuse
			pains. That concept is a bit idealist though, since many ergonomic
			inputs are designed to be maximally ergonomic for one position, and
			a more universal input often means an un-ergonomic design. (think
			ambidextrous mice, and their contours)
		</p>
		<p>
			I've heard of people tenting their mouse w/ thumb trackball, but
			that only solves the pronation. It's the best fix if you can't
			access a different input method, but it's not great for someone
			like me, considering buying a new one.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also mentioned vertical mice, and I think you can infer what
			bothers me about them. In a sense they're the inverse of a thumb
			trackball'd mouse. Better for your forearms, but still in the
			trappings of painful microadjustments. Inherently by making your
			hands move something with weight, you're adding extra resistance.
			There comes a point where less weight is worse, of course, as
			anyone who's tried to write in the air in VR can confirm :p.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, you'd be right in assuming i've pretty much dismissed the idea
			of a mouse-shaped input method. That leaves a few options, though,
			which I will ramble about at length.
		</p>
		<p>
			Trackpads are my current contender for optimal input method. Their
			weaknesses don't apply to me, since I already can't play mouse
			heavy games. They're ambidextrous, and have less moving parts (and
			less maintenance) than a trackball. I'm not opposed to a
			trackball, mind you. Once I exhaust potential trackpads to buy,
			I'll probably look at trackballs some more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Trackpads aren't without cons though. I've struggled to find a
			wireless trackpad that's good value for money. It seems like there's
			not much competition beyond the Apple trackpad, and weird no-name
			Amazon ones with questionable driver support. Additionally, the
			macro movement of moving from my keyboard to a trackpad is not much
			better than that with a mouse. At least the stationary nature of a
			trackpad makes it suitable for mounting between my keyboard, on my
			lap. That's a big win for portablility, especially if I can get help
			designing a good mounting system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Trackballs have some very clear wins in the kind of thing I like to
			do- I imagine controlling the Blender camera by rolling a ball
			around in place would be super intuitive, even if a similar method
			w/ a trackpad would be comparable. They also look really fun.
