<p>There&#39;s something really weird about online communities and the way interpersonal relationships are had there. It&#39;s hard for me to pinpoint, given I have no IRL relationships outside of the one person I live with. I&#39;ve never had normal community, so no normal frame of reference, but I&#39;ve determined I don&#39;t like internet communities and how they are.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t even start to write down all of my issues I have with the internet. Many have done that already anyway, and in better words than I can. But that&#39;s the issue! I think people aren&#39;t made to do this kind of global performance the internet asks for. No matter who you are, you&#39;re performing a version of yourself on the internet. I&#39;m doing it right now! I&#39;m the me who vaguely knows what they&#39;re on about, and is kinda funny in that goofy, awkward, maybe relatable way. I don&#39;t know how to turn it off!</p>
<p>I saw a post recently, that went something along the lines of "people used to only matter to their local community of a few hundred, and every community needs a singer, a storyteller, an artist, a crafter, etc. but near-instant worldwide media means that now the standard of what a singer is is so much higher, it scares off most people from genuine self expression, even if they would have been beloved by their community in the past".</p>
<p>And yeah. I think people need more room to be bad creative. I want to see more ugly paintings, more out of tune songs, more stone carvings that accidentally a word. People are weird and squishy and flawed, but people expect people to be normal and squishy and perfect.</p>
<p>I hate that I can feel all of these things and say them, yet know I&#39;m far from internalizing them myself. I can&#39;t apply that mindset to my own creations very well. It&#39;s damn hard! I don&#39;t know where to start! I think people should be allowed to be bad at things. I think I should be allowed to be bad at things. And I guess, in that logic, I should be allowed to be bad at allowing myself to be bad at things.</p>
<p>...you get my point.</p>
