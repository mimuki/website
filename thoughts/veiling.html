					<p>
            Veiling encompasses all sorts of intentionally covering or modifying
						(parts of) your body. It can be for a variety of reasons, but I'm
						talking about my relationship with it as a religious & spiritual 
						act, that like all things also carries over into my mundane life. 
						Maybe it's not for you, or you just think the scarves are pretty and 
						don't want to get into the metaphysical. Do what works for you- this 
						is just my experience of what works for me.
					</p>
				</section>

					<h1 id="you">What does veiling mean to you?</h1>
					<p>
						Whether you're a curious website wanderer, who has no idea what I'm 
						on about, or you've been veiling for decades, this is an important
						question. Religion and spirituality is not a monolith, and two
						different people can do polar opposite actions for the same goal. A
						great example of that is modesty- rejecting the concept of modest 
						dress and choosing to dress provocatively can be a liberating act, 
						but so can the opposite.
					</p>
					<p>
						For me, veiling affects my life in so many different ways, it's hard 
						to give a "single reason" as to why I do it. 
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 id = "god">Connecting to your Gods</h1>
					<p>
						As someone raised in a household with a very low-key interest in
						religion, I've always struggled with the idea of "religion time" and
						"secular time"; you're either engaging in your faith, or living a 
						"normal", non religious life, not thinking about religion in the
						slightest. I'm most fulfilled when my spirituality is intertwined in
						my daily life- engaging with the Gods and spirits around me is 
						rewarding and I always feel glad I did it after. But finding a way 
					  to invite that into your natural routine is really hard. Maybe you
						can go from never praying to praying every day, doing weekly
						offerings, and always working towards spiritual growth. But I can't.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite having been not-an-Atheist for more than half my life, I am 
						really bad at "doing" religion. If I don't consiously push myself,
						I will default to a secular approach to life, even though I don't 
						like it. A big key to counteracting that default has been small, yet 
						meaningful actions I can do consistently. Which ties perfectly into 
						veiling.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have the upper body strength to tie my own scarves each morning, 
						and the executive function to <em>usually</em> manage to do that. 
						It's a significant action for many reasons for me, but I love having
						an easy action to say "Hey, you're a big reason I'm where I am 
						today. This gesture is both a thank you and a promise, that I'll 
						continue to work on myself.". 
					</p>
					<p>
						Daily rituals need to be simple and low key. This and the tried and 
						true "pouring out a cold one for the boys" (offering a glass of 
						water) are the bread and butter of my practice as a disabled man
						with more pain than energy to do things. But without anything else,
						just veiling to remind myself "hey, I'm not an Atheist" is hollow.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>please laugh that title is very funny</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						...but my metaphysical experiences mean I stick with it anyway. All
						metaphysical experiences are nuanced and personal, and what I take 
						away from it may differe from you. Veiling gives me a distinct 
						feeling of safety, protection, and "you can keep your bad vibes over 
						there, thank you". I need to take care of myself and my body, and 
						veiling is an intuitive extension of that for me. It's a sieve that 
						filters out the funk and unpleasant aspects of the metaphysical, but 
						invites in what I can handle, on my terms. Or to phrase it simply:
						it's brain armour that makes me comfy cozy.
					</p>
					<p>
						I could totally get these same benefits from a well made ward. I 
						enjoy warding, but it's an energetically exhausting thing to do, and
						I'm embarrasingly out of practice. Ideally a combination of methods
						is best, but I'm not an enemy of the (metaphysical) state (yet), so 
						it's not a major concern for me. Erring on the side of too cautious
						is exhuasting, and I know that one first hand. 
					</p>

					<h1 id = "auto">Body autonomy, in this economy?</h1>
					<p>
						People love to dictate how you dress, in both overt and subtle ways.
						Even as a man, there are a lot of expectations on how I "should"
						look, and I found myself dressing to a heteronormative, white 
						person's opinion of attractive. I want to control when and how I am
						percieved, and veiling fits great into that reclamation of autonomy.
						I feel more comfortable with something on my head, so I'm gonna wear 
						it. It's more "socially acceptable" to ask someone to put their hood 
						down, even if they would prefer to keep their hood up. I've yet to 
						be asked to take off my turban, so it's a great way to assert that 
						actually, my comfort is more important than your aesthetics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Veiling also made me familiar with modesty, which I have a... 
						complicated relationship with. Ultimately my goal is to dress on my
						own terms, which means that I will show lots of skin on hot days, 
						because it's damn hot out. But in general I've found a lot of 
						comfort in showing a bit less skin, like wearing 3/4 tights under 
						my shorts, which tend to land mid-thigh, which I don't like 
						aesthetically, and it's uncomfortable when I'm in my wheelchair. 
						That also has the bonus of queering my outfit a little bit, 
						something I value a lot.
					</p>
					<p>
						I definitely think women & femme folks in general are able to have 
						more insightful takes on modesty than I can, but that's my 
						relationship to it, at least.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 id="me">My approach to veiling</h1>
					<p>
						It's important to start with this: everyone's relationship with
						veiling is their own, and I am no better or worse than someone else.
					</p>
					<p>
						With that out of the way... I veil every day, for the majority of 
						the day, even when I'm just staying home with my partner. I always
						veil when in public, and the vast majority of the time when with 
						friends. There are friends who I'm comfortable with seeing me 
						uncovered, but even then, I'm only doing that on my terms, which 
						usually means I don't. But should I be in the mood, I would.
					</p>
					<p>
						My go to styles are the old reliable turban- I have a method that's 
						secure and gentle on my arms. On warmer days I'll go for a loose, 
						over-the-shoulder scarf, but I don't wear that outside the house. 
						I've experimented with a variety of styles, and every so often I
						take notes from Wrapunzel's video tutorials, but in general I stick
						to what works best for me.
