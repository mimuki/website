I've been getting my shit together, and learning a bunch of neat (read: frustrating, challenging, but good to know) things. Apparently my nerve pain happens because when I bend my arms my ulnar nerve tries to escape its flesh prison, and wiggle out of the part of my arm that's trying to keep it safe. Also I have mild hearing loss, but not enough for the government to buy me hearing aids.

I've been doing volunteer knitting for the last year, and I finally finished! I have no idea if I'm going to keep knitting for them, but I did it! Woo!
