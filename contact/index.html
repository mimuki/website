    Commune with the webmaster from the comfort of your own home. I guess. Keep in mind that I'm thoroughly rubbish at one on one conversation, and if we share a community I'll generally prefer contacting you there.

<h2>Social media (derogatory)</h2>
<p>If we don't know you, we have a public account at <a href="https://weirder.earth/@mouseless">@mouseless@weirder.earth</a>, so feel free to say hi there.</p>
<p><a href="https://myfriendsare.gay/rats">@rats@myfriendsare.gay</a> is our &quot;main account&quot; on the fediverse, but it's also just for friends and people we know already. If that's you, just send us a message with your follow request if you use a different username there, so we know who you are.</p>
<p>We're also experimenting with XMPP, so if that's your jam, go pester rats@404.city. Just be warned we uh, don't actually know how XMPP works and are still figuring that out.</p>
<p>If all of those websites catch fire, (or you can't do regular social media) send us mail at (this domain minus the .net)@proton.me. If you'd like to contact me via Wii Mail, or some other esoteric contact method, ask us about it.</p>
