<h2>What?</h2>
<p>I'm learning about beading, and making some prayer beads in the process. Some day I'll have a clever way of letting you opt for just the mundane instructions vs the full personal gnosis &amp; theology cheesecake. Today is not that day, so you're getting both. I'm also really tired, so this is another half-done page. Such is the magic of chronic fatigue.</p>
</section><section><h2 id="first">First Attempt</h2>
<p>Before committing, i wanted to see if the process of making was fun, and I actually enjoyed using prayer beads. This is the process that I did, and it has its issues- unless you like learning by doing, I can't recommend copying my steps exactly.</p>
<h3>Tools used:</h3>
<ul>
<li>8mm beads (27)</li>
<li>6mm beads (3)</li>
<li>Mystery thread (similar to embroidery thread, held double)</li>
<li>Sewing needle</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Thread the...thread, into the needle. When it frayed, I cut the ends with scissors and tried again</li>
<li>Knot the two ends together a few times (enough so that the beads won't fall off)</li>
<li>Test that your sewing needle still fits through your beads. With mine, the 6mm beads had a smaller hole than the 8mm, so keep in mind that could be a thing.</li>
<li>Say the prayer that you would say at the start of using your prayer beads, if you have one.</li>
<li>Thread the first bead, pulling it down to the starting knot.</li>
<li>Create additional knots as close to that bead as possible, threading the bead through the hole. If you accidentally do one too far, you should be able to get away with it- but try not to.</li>
<li>when the bead definitely doesn't slip past the knot, say it's corresponding prayer.</li>
<li>repeat 6-8 until you have all your beads on, changing sizes and/or prayers as needed.</li>
<li>If you have an ending prayer, say that.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>Parts of my method sucked, and i learned from it. (todo)</p>
</section><section><h2 id="pentacle">Pentacle Rosaryn't</h2>
<p>So, I haven't actually made this yet, but I have an ongoing plan to make a really cool set of prayer beads. The approximate shape (round bit, center piece, straight bit) is similar to a rosary, hence the title. but I just think it's a good shape. I have a cool, hand forged pentacle <a href="/thoughts/gifts/#100">that i'd love to get some day</a>, and when I find the energy I'll outline my plans here.</p>
<p>The rough idea is 9x9 beads with a smaller bead between them, connected to the pentacle, with a smaller straight bit of beads (3x3? unsure) for starting and ending prayers.</p>
