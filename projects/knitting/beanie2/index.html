    <h2>Progess Log</h2>
<p>Despite what I said about this patern before, I decided to do it again. Maybe my hands have gotten stronger, or maybe my pain tolerance is higher, but the 3mm needles arent so bad now. Less comfortable, sure, but when I'm taking regular breaks and not doing too much in a day it's been fine. Currently just cruising along in the ribbing, which is looking really nice.</p>
<p>I decided to do it &quot;properly&quot; (as in, per the pattern, without the surprise alteration from last time), but I found that threw my gauge way off. I would need to drop down to 4mm needles, or maybe even 3.4mm, to keep the gauge I wanted. So I went back to what I did originally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the tension I get doing <em>that</em> is tighter than it should be, so I end up with crampy fingers after a while. I don't viciously hate the pattern like I used to, but I think I should invest in different sizes of needles before doing it again. As of writing I'm about to do the decreases at the top of the head- the body went by super uneventfully, with nothing notable to talk about. It's a simple pattern, and I can chug away at it with the entire thing in my head, so it flies by.</p>
<p>Decreases at the top went fine, and all in all this beanie was pretty uneventful.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I still wish this pattern let the finished beanie lay flat more neatly, it's not a big deal, but... it makes taking pictures annoying. I think I should have done less ribbing on this one, too, but again that doesn't bug me much.</p>
<h2>Alterations</h2>
<p>Just like last time, I replaced all of the knit 3 togethers with knit 3 together through the back loop. It leads to a different look, for sure. But I like it, and I didn't like the gauge I was getting otherwise.</p>
