    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
<p>I started this one by accidentally miscounting the pattern, and casting on an extra 30 or so stitches. No big deal though, I snuck in a few increases to reach the next multiple that would work for the pattern. I then proceeded to do 6 hours of knitting in one day, for some reason. I guess I'm just the kind of knitter that likes the soothing repetition of making big things. I tried out a new technique of joining a colour in, and it worked perfectly the first time. Then after needing to do it again on the other side, 10+ tries and it still wasn't working. I have no idea what went wrong, so it's in timeout for the week while i use my surprise free time to work on my own projects.</p>
<p>This is going to be <em>huge</em>, too. Like, I'm currently using a 90cm cable, lets call it a meter including the needles. It's too big to lay flat. My initial plan was a lap blanket, but I think this is going to be more &quot;small throw&quot; sized. Works for me, I have a lot of yarn in these colours. I have 5 balls each of red and white, which I <em>think</em> should result in me making a sizable but not quite square blanket. That's the good thing with blankets, there's no &quot;wrong&quot; size. Hell, even if i hate the pattern, I can just call this a horizontally constructed scarf and end it early.</p>
