    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
<p>I started this one by accidentally miscounting the pattern, and casting on an extra 30 or so stitches. No big deal though, I snuck in a few increases to reach the next multiple that would work for the pattern. I then proceeded to do 6 hours of knitting in one day, for some reason. I guess I'm just the kind of knitter that likes the soothing repetition of making big things. I tried out a new technique of joining a colour in, and it worked perfectly the first time. Then after needing to do it again on the other side, 10+ tries and it still wasn't working. I have no idea what went wrong, so it's in timeout for the week while i use my surprise free time to work on my own projects.</p>
<p>This is going to be <em>huge</em>, too. Like, I'm currently using a 90cm cable, lets call it a meter including the needles. It's too big to lay flat. My initial plan was a lap blanket, but I think this is going to be more &quot;small throw&quot; sized. Works for me, I have a lot of yarn in these colours. I have 5 balls each of red and white, which I <em>think</em> should result in me making a sizable but not quite square blanket. That's the good thing with blankets, there's no &quot;wrong&quot; size. Hell, even if i hate the pattern, I can just call this a horizontally constructed scarf and end it early.</p>
<p>...A devastating discovery has been made- I've done about 3 repeats of the white/red colour change, and... <em><strong>it looks like strips of bacon</strong></em>. I should have made the stripes wider, but I didn't, so this is my life now. I honestly find this hilarious, and arguably a feature. It looks like a good pace for me is one white+one red section per week, and at that rate this is gonna take me months to finish, but I'm in no rush.</p>
<p>Also, I've got a better idea of scale now- it's not quite edge to edge on my double bed, but it covers enough that I'd call it double bed sized. No idea how long I'll make it, but that's the width.</p>
<p>This has been a very unremarkable project to write about. I've just been kinda... chugging through it, really. I got very miserable over the work/life balance since I was only finding time for government knitting, but I'm feeling better now. I'm now knitting at scheduled times (when I get to hang out with my favourite clowns, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays), and that has helped so much. Knitting was feeling like an obligation I did in order to survive under capitalism, (which it was and is) but now it's that but also a fun hobby &amp; way to keep my hands busy.</p>
<p>The more I knit, the less bacon-y the pattern looks, too.</p>
