    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
<p>Friendship ended with beanies, shawls are my new best friend. This one is bottom up and needs a nearly 300 stitch cast on...wow.</p>
<p>I misread the pattern at the start, and I honestly think it's a good thing. It essentially added a garter border to help with curling, and its overall a happy accident. It's otherwise been a super chilled out project. Having 300 stitches on your needles is both good and bad, because you have to commit to at least 20 minutes of knitting when you start a row. More if you get distracted or don't like speedrunning your hobbies, like me.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because I have more experience than when I made the first shawl, but this pattern seems a lot easier, and I've had an especially easy time reading my own knitting. I think the more &quot;plain&quot; pattern lends itself better to this yarn, which I'm grateful for. The colours have pooled in a way I find really interesting.</p>
<p>As of writing I recently did the first decrease, and making progress twice as fast is really good for getting hyped to work on this. The more I do, the faster it'll go, and that's cool!</p>
<p>This shawl really flew by. It was an absolute pleasure to knit, and speeding up towards the end was very cool. Surprisingly the entire process was pretty uneventful, and no major mistakes or mixups happened.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Wow, this was a fun one. Just sorta...breezed through it, and all was well. Definitely one I'd do again, its a good choice for showing off multi colour yarns.</p>
