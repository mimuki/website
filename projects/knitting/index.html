    <p>
      I'm not disabled enough for the Disability Support Pension, so in order to 
      live I get the Jobseeker payment, which needs you to be actively seeking
      employment (or becoming more employable). As part of my mutual obligations
      I had to apply to volunteer jobs, and take the first one that accepted me,
      which lead me to volunteer knitting. I will put my income at risk by 
      quitting, thus the term Government Mandated Knitting is born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I'll document the stuff I make, until writing about them stops being
      good to me.

      Pattern: Hinagiku hat (<a href = "https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hinagiku-hat">free on Ravelry</a>)
    <br>
      Yarn: 1.5 balls of 4 Seasons Flinders 8ply Cotton in Ruby 
      (<a href = "https://www.spotlightstores.com/art-craft/yarn-needle-art/yarn/cotton-blends/4-seasons-flinders-cotton-8-ply-yarn/80552891">Spotlight AU</a>)
    </p>
    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
    <p>
      This pattern was a bit of a doozy to start with. The ribbing is done on 
      3mm needles, which are really painful for me. Once you get past that, 
      every other round has a lot of knit 3 togethers, and juggling between your
      left and right needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly one of the decisions of all time. Really slow to work on, but I've
      picked up speed as I get used to it. About 8 hours in I made a mistake,
      causing the pretty spiral to become a weird straight line on one side,
      thanks to an extra stitch that snuck in at one point. But after giving it 
      some time in Yarn Jail before frogging, I went back to work and the rest
      of the hat went really smoothly. By the end of it, I've really come around
      on this pattern, and it's not as hard as it felt when I started. I guess
      I've never done a pattern like this before.
    </p>
    <h2>Alterations</h2>
    <p>
      For no reason in particular, I replaced all of the knit 3 togethers with
      knit 3 together through the back loop. I don't remember why, I honestly 
      think I started doing it as a mistake, and when I noticed just went 
      "whelp, guess I'm doing this now".
    </p>
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I like this pattern. I was very skeptical of how it decreases so quickly
      on the crown, but it seems to look fine, so I guess it's fine. This is my
      first successful beanie anyways, so maybe that's just how they are. Next 
      time, I would do the crown on 4.5mm double pointed needles, but I don't 
      own any, so I'm not losing sleep over it. Only a knitter would notice 
      anyways, and it was better than the alternative of going down to 3mm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yarn is also nice. Got it on sale, too, but even full price it's slightly
      cheaper than my usual brand. For "bang for your buck", I recommend it. If
      you've got the money to support a local business instead, though...
      maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't at all recommend this for Government Mandated Knitting, at least 
      not before doing a swatch to see how the pattern works up. It was very 
      slow to start with, before I got used to the rhythm, and that was 
      massively demotivating. Making for yourself or a loved one, though, I 
      thoroughly recommend it. It's free besides your time, after all.

      Yarn: 1.8 balls of Abbey Road Freedom 8ply Cotton in Freckles
      (<a href = "https://www.spotlightstores.com/art-craft/yarn-needle-art/yarn/cotton-knitting-yarn/abbey-road-freedom-cotton-yarn/80571732">Spotlight AU</a>)
    </p>
    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
    <p>
      After a few false starts with other, more boring shawls, I started this
      one off eager to go. The garter tab is something I tried once before, so 
      now I properly get how it's supposed to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiers 1 and 2 were a breeze. Fun to work, colours have been good, aside from the occasional yarn over I forgot to do, no major mistakes. Tier 3,
      however... Its a lot of stitches, and a lot of room for error. I  made
      a variety of mistakes early on, and some will be living in the final product
      too. As a result of that, I drew on the charts to make it clear how many
      times I need to repeat certain parts of the pattern, and after that it's 
      been smooth sailing and (mostly) error free.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing tier 3, the lower section was a nice change of pace. 
      Absolutely perfect in terms of complexity- no awkward number juggling, 
      easy but not boring... It was a really enjoyable way to end a shawl. For
      my personal one I'm planning on doing more repeats than the pattern calls
      for, I just didn't have enough yarn for it here.
    </p>
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Love this pattern. It's so good. Already working on another one for myself.
      I will admit, though, that the yarn's colour changes were somehow 
      both too slow, and too fast, and aren't my personal taste for this specific
      shawl, even if the colours are pretty. Better suited to a smaller project, 
      I think. Lovely to work with though, but keep in mind the colour changes 
      aren't perfect, and that slight irregularlity might not suit what you want
      to use it for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I've made this, I know that big lacy shawls are fun for me, and a 
      good Government Mandated Knitting project.

     (<a href = "https://www.spotlightstores.com/art-craft/yarn-needle-art/yarn/cotton-knitting-yarn/abbey-road-freedom-cotton-yarn/80571717">Spotlight AU</a>)
    </p>
    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
    <p>
      Friendship ended with beanies, shawls are my new best friend. This one is bottom up and needs a nearly 300 stitch cast on...wow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I misread the pattern at the start, and I honestly think it's a good thing. It essentially added a garter border to help with curling, and its overall a happy accident. It's otherwise been a super chilled out project. Having 300 stitches on your needles is both good and bad, because you have to commit to at least 20 minutes of knitting when you start a row. More if you get distracted or don't like speedrunning your hobbies, like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it's because I have more experience than when I made the first shawl, but this pattern seems a lot easier, and I've had an especially easy time reading my own knitting. I think the more "plain" pattern lends itself better to this yarn, which I'm grateful for. The colours have pooled in a way I find really interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of writing I recently did the first decrease, and making progress twice as fast is really good for getting hyped to work on this. The more I do, the faster it'll go, and that's cool!
