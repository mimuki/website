    <h1>Government Mandated Knitting</h1>
    <p>
      I'm not disabled enough for the Disability Support Pension, so in order to 
      live I get the Jobseeker payment, which needs you to be actively seeking
      employment (or becoming more employable). As part of my mutual obligations
      I had to apply to volunteer jobs, and take the first one that accepted me,
      which lead me to volunteer knitting. I will put my income at risk by 
      quitting, thus the term Government Mandated Knitting is born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I'll document the stuff I make, until writing about them stops being
      good to me.

      Started: Feb 2023
    <br>
      Finished: Mar 2023
    <br>
      Total Time: ~20 hours
    <br>
      Pattern: <a href = "https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hinagiku-hat">
      Hinagiku hat (free on Ravelry)</a>
    <br>
      Yarn: 1 and a bit balls of <a href = "https://www.spotlightstores.com/art-craft/yarn-needle-art/yarn/cotton-blends/4-seasons-flinders-cotton-8-ply-yarn/80552891"> 4 Seasons Flinders 8ply 
      Cotton in Ruby</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
    <p>
      This pattern was a bit of a doozy to start with. The ribbing is done on 
      3mm needles, which are really painful for me. Once you get past that, 
      every other round has a lot of knit 3 togethers, and juggling between your
      left and right needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly one of the decisions of all time. Really slow to work on, but I've
      picked up speed as I get used to it. About 8 hours in I made a mistake,
      causing the pretty spiral to become a weird straight line on one side,
      thanks to an extra stitch that snuck in at one point. But after giving it 
      some time in Yarn Jail before frogging, I went back to work and the rest
      of the hat went really smoothly. By the end of it, I've really come around
      on this pattern, and it's not as hard as it felt when I started. I guess
      I've never done a pattern like this before.
    </p>
    <h2>Alterations</h2>
    <p>
      For no reason in particular, I replaced all of the knit 3 togethers with
      knit 3 together through the back loop. I don't remember why, I honestly 
      think I started doing it as a mistake, and when I noticed just went 
      "whelp, guess I'm doing this now".
    </p>
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I like this pattern. I was very skeptical of how it decreases so quickly
      on the crown, but it seems to look fine, so I guess it's fine. This is my
      first successful beanie anyways, so maybe that's just how they are. Next 
      time, I would do the crown on 4.5mm double pointed needles, but I don't 
      own any, so I'm not losing sleep over it. Only a knitter would notice 
      anyways, and it was better than the alternative of going down to 3mm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yarn is also nice. Got it on sale, too, but even full price it's slightly
      cheaper than my usual brand. For "bang for your buck", I recommend it. If
      you've got the money to support a local business instead, though...
      maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't at all recommend this for Government Mandated Knitting, at least 
      not before doing a swatch to see how the pattern works up. It was very 
      slow to start with, before I got used to the rhythm, and that was 
      massively demotivating. Making for yourself or a loved one, though, I 
      thoroughly recommend it. It's free besides your time, after all.

      Pattern: (soon)

    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
    <p>
      After a few false starts with other, more boring shawls, I started this
      one off eager to go. The garter tab is something I tried once before, so 
      now I properly get how it's supposed to work. I'm really hopeful that the 
      colours of this yarn lend themselves well to this pattern.
