<h2>Why is it government mandated?</h2>
<p>I'm not disabled enough for the Disability Support Pension, so in order to live I get the Jobseeker payment, which needs you to be actively seeking employment (or becoming more employable). As part of my mutual obligations I had to apply to volunteer jobs, and take the first one that accepted me, which lead me to volunteer knitting. I will put my income at risk by quitting, thus the term Government Mandated Knitting is born.</p>
<p>While that's a bit miserable and dystopian, at least I get a lot of creative liberty to make stuff that makes me happy.</p>
