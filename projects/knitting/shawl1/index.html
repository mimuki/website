    <h2>Progress Log</h2>
<p>After a few false starts with other, more boring shawls, I started this one off eager to go. The garter tab is something I tried once before, so now I properly get how it's supposed to work.</p>
<p>Tiers 1 and 2 were a breeze. Fun to work, colours have been good, aside from the occasional yarn over I forgot to do, no major mistakes. Tier 3, however... Its a lot of stitches, and a lot of room for error. I made a variety of mistakes early on, and some will be living in the final product too. As a result of that, I drew on the charts to make it clear how many times I need to repeat certain parts of the pattern, and after that it's been smooth sailing and (mostly) error free.</p>
<p>After finishing tier 3, the lower section was a nice change of pace. Absolutely perfect in terms of complexity- no awkward number juggling, easy but not boring... It was a really enjoyable way to end a shawl. For my personal one I'm planning on doing more repeats than the pattern calls for, I just didn't have enough yarn for it here.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Love this pattern. It's so good. Already working on another one for myself. I will admit, though, that the yarn's colour changes were somehow both too slow, and too fast, and aren't my personal taste for this specific shawl, even if the colours are pretty. Better suited to a smaller project, I think. Lovely to work with though, but keep in mind the colour changes aren't perfect, and that slight irregularlity might not suit what you want to use it for.</p>
<p>Now that I've made this, I know that big lacy shawls are fun for me, and a good Government Mandated Knitting project.</p>
