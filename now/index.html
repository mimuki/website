    <h1>/now/</h1>
    <p>
      Here's everything that's changed and changing in my life lately.
      The idea is that if we haven't spoken in 6 months, this is the kind
      of stuff I wanna tell you about.

    <h1>Minecraft!!</h1>
    <p>
      I've been playing minecraft again, on a private server with my closest
      friends. We have a bunch of identity affirming mods, and <em>damn</em> I
      have been having so much fun. There's even proximity voice chat, and I've 
      recently figured out a good solution for live subtitles of what everyone's
      saying.

    <h1>Old web pet games, my beloved</h1>
    <p>
      I used to play PokéFarm back in the day, and I recently got the itch to 
      try it out again. It might have already been like it, and I was just too 
      young to care, but it's got a lot of microtransactions and "pay to not 
      spend weeks grinding", that I am just not a fan of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus began my quest to find a different pet sim that scratched that itch.
      Turns out PokéFarm was inspired by a different site, Global PokéDex Plus,
      and I like that site a lot more. I've been playing it pretty casually the 
      last month or so, and you might see some of my pokémon scattered around
      this website. You can feed them if you want, but don't feel 
      pressured to, I'm not into grindy minmaxing. At the bottom of my home page
      are all of the shinies (rare variants of normal pokémon) that I've collected.

    <h1>...mimuki employment arc?</h1>
    <p>
      As part of my personal hell of "I'm too disabled to work, but not 
      disabled enough for the government to let me not work", if I want to
      keep having an income, I need to be working on self improvement to
      make me more employable. Part of that was applying to volunteer
      work which for the most part, were positions no one would hire a 
      disabled man for. But I got a job! I now have government mandated
      knitting, and I need to keep knitting or risk losing my income.
    </p>
    <p>
      As dystopian and miserable as that is, I like to knit, and I was 
      gonna do it anyway, so at least there's that. And I'm supporting an
      organization that (among other things) supports rural & Indigenous 
      communities, so at least its morally good work, unlike most.

    <h1>Wheelchair upgrades, baby!</h1>
    <p>
      I recently set up a ko-fi, and got a surprising amount of support
      there. With that I've replaced my casters for some glittery gold
      ones, and got some pre-loved brakes working. This chair is always in 
      a state of falling apart, but this extra money has meant that I can 
      buy extras of the most fragile pieces (mainly screws that like to 
      rust or get stripped), which is such a reassuring experience.
