<h2>Minecraft!</h2>
<p>I've been playing minecraft again, on a private server with my closest friends. We have a bunch of identity affirming mods, and damn I have been having so much fun. There's even proximity voice chat, and I've recently figured out a good solution for live subtitles of what everyone's saying.</p>

<h2>...mimuki employment arc?</h2>
<p>As part of my personal hell of &quot;I'm too disabled to work, but not disabled enough for the government to let me not work&quot;, if I want to keep having an income, I need to be working on self improvement to make me more employable. Part of that was applying to volunteer work which for the most part, were positions no one would hire a disabled man for. But I got a job! I now have government mandated knitting, and I need to keep knitting or risk losing my income.</p>
<p>As dystopian and miserable as that is, I like to knit, and I was gonna do it anyway, so at least there's that. And I'm supporting an organization that (among other things) supports rural &amp; Indigenous communities, so at least its morally good work, unlike most.</p>
