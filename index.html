      This is my little corner of the internet. I'm a 23 year old full time
      cyborg with things I feel like sharing. My hobbies include VR games,
      mechanical keyboards, hitting bigots in the kneecaps, and knitting.

    <h1>The most website of all time!</h1>
    <p>
      Feel free to poke around, try and break things, steal ideas, and anything 
      else that serves you well. This is my metaphorical workshop, and the door 
      is open. (in that analogy, what are my tools? when one of my friends
      "borrows" a hammer and never returns it, what does that mean? what's
      the website equivalent to a laser printer?)

    <h1>Recent changes</h1>
    <p>
      Cool updates will live here for a while, when I remember to.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Updated my <a href="/projects/knitting">Government Mandated Knitting</a> 
          with my first finished project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added some cute little guys to my website. You can click them if you 
          want to, but you don't have to.
        </li>
        <li>
          I converted this entire website to be generated with 
          <a href="https://11ty.dev">eleventy</a>, and ideally, you shouldn't 
          be able to tell the difference. Just know that it was really hard 
          and it's really cool now, I swear.
