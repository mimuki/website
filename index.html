  <h1>There used to be a website here, but now there isn't.</h1>
  <p>
  sorry, i'm just kinda going through it right now. 
  </p>
  <p>
  i don't know if this site will come back up or not, but i don't think its some grand loss to humanity or whatever. most of the people who wanted to see it have already. nothing of value has been lost.
