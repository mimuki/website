Good question! Some phrases that could be used to describe me are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
bitter cripplepunk disaster

<li>
novice contemplative

<li>
DIY cyborg

<li>
consistently inconsistent

<li>
regretful computer toucher

</ul>

My pronouns are he/him, except when they aren't. I'm in my mid 20s, and am reaching that point in life where it's too much effort to increment my age on websites every year.

<div id="Home-Why a website?"><h2 id="Why a website?" class="header"><a href="#Home-Why a website?">Why a website?</a></h2></div>

You might remember the old website- it was very pretty, but it was not making me happy. I was overwhelmed by its complexity, and I'm trying a more plaintexty approach, and taking things extra slow, even if that means things look a bit bland and boring for now.
